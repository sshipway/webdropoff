Version 2.6

dropoff.conf : Global configuration file for all
dropoff : CGI script for dropping off files.  This can be password protected 
          if you want it to be.
waiting : CGI script to view all files currently waiting.  This must be 
          password protected becuase it gives visibility of all dropoff files.
          Should be used by admins only!
pickup : CGI script to pick up files.  This should not be password protected
         unless you are only dropping off for authenticated users.
cleandropoff : Script to prune log file and clean up dropoff directory, 
               according to retention limits set in the dropoff.conf
makekeypair : CGI Script to create public key pairs.  This must be password
              protected as it stores keys by authenticated username.
smtpdropoff : Script to be called from (x)inetd to accept files dropped off
              via SMTP (eg: Ricoh MFD scan-to-email)
smtpdropoff.xinetd : Xinetd configuration file for smtpdropoff
*.inc : These are HTML templates for the head and foot of the generated pages.
        Put them in a directory and configure this in the dropoff.conf
decrypt : Utility to decrypt a stored file, given a private key
xpickup.pl : ActivePerl/Tk script for windows clients to pick up and decrypt
             all in one go.  Requires Crypt::SSLeay if using https, plus the
             Crypt::RSA, Crypt::CBC and Crypt::Blowfish modules.
xpickup.exe : PAR-compiled copy of xpickup.pl that should work standalone,
              but this is not fully tested.  Hardcoded to UoA pickup URL 
              though so of dubious use.

# All scripts need to have the configuration file location set

# encrypt/decrypt require Crypt::CBC, Crypt::Blowfish, Crypt::RSA

# SMTPdropoff only currently works properly for RICOH MFDs
